This category includes deep foundation systems such as piles (driven, bored, or helical), caissons (drilled or poured-in-place), and underpinning systems designed to support existing structures or to address challenging soil conditions.  It also incorporates complex foundation solutions like raft foundations, which distribute loads over a large area, and grade beams, which tie individual foundation elements together for improved structural stability. Dewatering systems, essential for maintaining stable excavation conditions during the construction of special foundations in saturated soils, are explicitly included.  Rock excavation is only included if it is integral to the construction of the special foundation itself; otherwise, it falls under standard foundation or excavation categories.  Pile caps, being a separate structural component atop the piles, are classified separately under standard foundations.  This element accounts for all unique and site-specific foundation requirements beyond those addressed in standard foundation classifications.  The scope should clearly delineate the boundaries between rock excavation associated with the special foundation and that associated with general site preparation or basement excavation.'"
