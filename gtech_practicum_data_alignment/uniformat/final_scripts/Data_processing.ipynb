It includes the design and installation of deep foundation elements such as piling, which involves driving or drilling long, slender elements into the ground, and caissons, which are large-diameter drilled shafts. The scope also covers underpinning, a method used to strengthen or increase the depth of an existing foundation. Large-area load distribution systems like raft foundations (mat foundations) are included, providing a continuous slab over the entire building footprint. Grade beams, often used in conjunction with deep foundations to connect individual piles or caissons and support walls, are also part of this classification. Furthermore, any dewatering processes specifically necessitated by the complexity of special foundation construction fall under this element. This category is broad enough to encompass any other unique or complex foundation conditions that deviate from standard shallow footing applications.'}]"
